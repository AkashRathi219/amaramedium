    <section id="intro">
        <div class="container">
            <p class="intro-text">You are here because you miss someone. Your heart is learning to live with an absence
                others may not see. You may have been told to be strong, to find closure, or to move on — but your love
                hasn’t stopped, and neither has your grief. And that’s okay.</p>
            <p class="intro-text"> Grief is love with no place to go.</p>
            <p class="intro-text">Amara means 'that which never ends'. It reflects a simple truth: love does not
                disappear
                when someone dies. The connection remains — seeking a new way to exist. AmaraMedium is a space where
                that love is gently given a home again. Through mediumship, the bond you share is honoured, felt, and
                allowed to continue — not as it was, but in its pure essence.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">Here, you are not told how to grieve. You are not rushed. Your grief in all its forms
                — the sadness, the confusion, the quiet longing — is welcome. This is a place where you can bring your
                whole heart, exactly as it is.</p>

            <p class="section-blurb">My work sits at the intersection of grief support and spiritual connection. I offer
                two forms of support, often woven together:</p>

            <div class="services-grid">
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h3>Grief Coaching</h3>
                    <p>A compassionate space to navigate your emotions. We talk about what you’re carrying—the pain, the
                        memories, the challenges of daily life without your person. This is about helping you find your
                        footing and a way to live forward, without ever being asked to leave your love behind.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h3>Mediumship</h3>
                    <p>A gentle, evidential connection where I relay messages from your loved ones in spirit. These
                        sessions focus on reassurance, love, and the continuity of your bond. It is not about spectacle
                        or proof, but seeded in comfort and ethical connection.</p>

                <p class="expect-intro">A session is a safe, supportive conversation. There is no pressure, no
                    performance, and no "right way" to feel.</p>
                <ul class="elegant-list">
                    <li>We will talk about what you’re experiencing.</li>

                    <li> You will be gently supported with tools to navigate and regulate your emotions, helping you
                        feel less isolated and more connected to life — without guilt, anger, resentment, or the weight
                        of loss.</li>
                    <li>You don’t need to believe in anything specific. You don’t need to be "ready" or have questions
                        prepared. You only need to come as you are.</li>

                        “I had a mediumship session with Shagun. Contrary to visual media, the reading happens in a
                        regular room with no smoke shells or magic balls around. After knowing the issues that I was
                        looking for, Shagun tapped into the energies and connected with my grandfather. I have been
                        looking for some answers to a complex (in my mind) ancestral issue, and received clear specific
                        answers that made complete sense to me. It brought about a lot of clarity to me plus an immense
                        sense of calm, once this issue was resolved. The knowledge that I have angels (my grandfather)
                        looking out for me, was profoundly comforting. ♥️♥️ Thank you so much, Shagun, for this
                        session.”

                        opportunity to connect with Shagun ma'am for a Mediumship session and it was a truly
                        transformative experience. Her ability to tap into the spiritual realm and convey messages from
                        loved ones was astounding. During the reading, she mentioned a specific detail about my grand
                        father's gait, his height, which immediately validated the connection. The insights, guidance
                        and assurance I received were remarkably accurate and resonated deeply with me. Shagun ma'am
                        created a safe and compassionate space for me to explore my concerns and questions. "The clarity
                        I gained regarding my life path was worth every penny. I walked away with absolute confirmation
                        that my grand parents are nearby to guide me. I'm grateful for her gentle guidance and the
                        clarity brought to my life. If you're seeking connection, guidance or closure, I highly
                        recommend Shagun ma'am's Mediumship sessions.”

                <h2>Hello, I am Shagun</h2>
                <p>I am an Energy Transformation Coach, and an Evidential Medium. I believe that goodbye is not the end
                    of your story together. The bond you share continues, and you do not have to walk this path of loss
                    alone.

                    I work with the tools of Access Consciousness® to support emotional, energetic, and life shifts —
                    helping change what is not working in areas such as relationships, money, business, career, and the
                    body. With over eight years of experience, I have had the privilege of supporting many people
                    through meaningful transformation.</p>

                <p>My mediumship training is from Arthur Findlay College, Stansted, where I trained under some of the
                    world’s leading mediums. Evidential mediumship is a grounded and ethical form of mediumship that
                    brings specific, verifiable evidence of the ongoing connection between you and your loved ones.</p>
                <p class="cta-text">If you feel a quiet pull to reach out, trust it. You are ready when you have the
                    willingness to take the first step. And then, I am here to walk beside you.</p>
